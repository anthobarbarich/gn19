text = "For the first time, Les Garages Numériques offer a meeting, thinking and exchange space for professionals in the digital sector. GN PRO is a national and international platform that allows them to network, attend masterclasses, meet local and international artists but also to discover the exhibition through a guided tour. With the aim of being practical and concrete, GN PRO will be divided into two times. At first, thematic conferences will be offered to participants. They will consist of case studies of specific projects or works. The goal is to bring out good practices and establish workflows."

The goal is on one hand to fill the order book of artists and creators and, on the other hand, to bring creative and innovative solutions to institutions and agencies wishing to renew their audiences and their targets."
