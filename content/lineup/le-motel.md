His love for ethnic music combined with elements from footwork, hip-hop, jazz and techno leads to a beautiful collage between electronic and organic elements. This love for eclectism also reflects in the people he collaborates with such as Rom√©o Elvis, YellowStraps, Clap! Clap! Or more recently Veence Hanao. Alongside visual artist Antointe De Schuyter he will be talking at GN Pro about their brand new A/V performance."
