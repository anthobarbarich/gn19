description = "Le Motel (Fabien Leclercq) is a producer and graphic designer based in Brussels. His love for ethnic music combined with elements from footwork, hip-hop, jazz and techno leads to a beautiful collage between electronic and organic elements. This love for eclectism also reflects in the people he collaborates with such as Roméo Elvis, YellowStraps, Clap! Clap! Or more recently Veence Hanao. Alongside visual artist Antointe De Schuyter he will be talking at GN Pro about their brand new A/V performance. Moderation : Céline Dejoie."
