description = "Inspired by long form ceremonial music of Tibet and other religions, where the intent is to lose oneself in the music – to meditate or achieve a trance state – Time Machines became Drew McDowall’s “electronic punk-primitive” project after multiple solo releases. Each of the four pieces on Time Machines is named after the chemical compound of the hallucinogenic drug that they were composed for, and the album was meticulously crafted to enable what John Balance referred to as \"temporal slips\" in time and space, allowing both the artist and audience to figuratively \"dissolve time\"."
