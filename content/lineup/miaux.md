description = "Some of the most gentle, expressive music coming from the Belgian underground surely can be found in the work of Miaux, the operating handle of Sarajevo born Belgian Mia Prce. Miaux is a mistress of elaborate keyboard shenanigans of a very soundtrackly nature. It is soaked with a haunted, lonely quality that touches the edges of mystery like a torch. Armed with a Casio and devastating song writing skills, her music is minimal, melancholic and timeless."
