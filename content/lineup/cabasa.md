description = "Belgian-born Cabasa has been shaped by formative years spent overhearing the early strains of electronic favoured by his dad – a one-time fixture of Belgium’s new beat scene – and the so-called «post-dubstep diaspora» that was so ubiquitous at the turn of the decade. The resultant cross-pollination of styles feels like a melting pot of influential UK labels old and new: Warp, On-U Sound, Good Looking Records, Hessle Audio or Livity Sound, the impression British music had made on this fledgling producer is undeniable."
