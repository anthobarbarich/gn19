description = "«HYMN» is a monumental immersive laser installation created by brussels artists Antoine Goldschmidt and Ofer Smilansky. Based on Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Hymn of Cherubim, the work, composed as a triptych, explores in an abstract way the relationship between man and machine, ancient and modern, harmony and chaos. By associating the harmonic purity of the voices with the almost tangible intensity of lasers, HYMN invites us to a timeless journey, where sound and light are transformed into an immersive, intense and sensitive experience.\nCreated by Antoine Goldschmidt & Ofer Smilansky\nProduction by MagicStreet\nIn partnership with Laser System Europe"
