description = "Kate Miller’s style is ever evolving and takes influence both from her time spent in Berlin and back home in Melbourne. Now Berlin-based, she’s the Oscillate events and label co-organiser. Her sets are varied and ever evolving, going from the most recent releases to classic old school gems, merging the funky and the dreamy, the uplifting and the dark. One thing is certain though: Kate always gets the people dancing."
