description = "Born from a fascination between science, sound and light, the «frequencies» project led Nicolas Bernier to interest himself with the quantum – the smallest unit of energy. The artist explores the conceptual relationships between quantum physics principles and audio luminescent art: particles, probabilities, duality wave/corpuscle and discontinuity. The composition, metaphorically structured around these principles, articulates in real time one hundred audio-visual fragments in a random spatio-temporal efflorescence, building itself continuously before our eyes. The signs, lines and dots engraved on its panels come to life when exposed to light, constantly creating new visual compositions through reflections. The device thereby proposes a singular three-dimensional vision in space."
