description = "There is a shifting border between the movement of clouds and the behavior of microscopic elements. There is a fluid frontier between serenity and chaos. You see landscapes , You see particles. I see movement and i see remission. It is magnetic and it turns to liquid. Surrounded by acoustic vibrations, the installation distorts time, boundaries and scales. \nLike an oracle mirror, it emits and reflects, ever changing and always the same."
