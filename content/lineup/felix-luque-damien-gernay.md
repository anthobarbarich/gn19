description = "Their installation refers to a speculative and fictional interpretation of black holes which appear in the «Memory Lane» project. Technically, the holes are subjective points of the 3D scanner. This means that, in the 3D rendering, a lack of information appears where the machine is physically placed. The «VOID» installation materializes these virtual black holes into metaphorical voids. These black holes are considered as a kind of antimatter, spatiotemporal holes which links the physical world to virtual landscapes. Felix Luque will also be talking during ]unframed[ Talks on Saturday 9."
