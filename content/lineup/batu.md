description = "Batu and his tight-knit Timedance label have pushed boundaries, putting Bristol firmly at the center of global bass-minded music culture. His efforts have given him a number of critically acclaimed years, including a series of standout EPs, remixes for Sampha and R&S Records, and establishing Timedance as one of the most vital proponents of fresh UK dance music. His DJing is also increasingly respected worldwide. A standout set at Dekmantel’s Selectors festival earned him a place in The Guardian’s «Best Mixes of 2018» list, and Mixmag ranked him as one of their top 20 DJs in 2017."
