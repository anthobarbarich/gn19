description = "Radiotherapy medical physicist during daytime, creative coder during nighttime. When rain hits the windscreen, he sees the tracks that alpha particles trace in cells. When he pulls the plug in the bath tub, he stays to watch the little whirlpool. When he sits at the kitchen table, he plays with the glasses to see the caustics. At a candle light dinner, he stares into the flame. Sometimes at night, he find himself behind the computer. When he finally blinks, a mess of code is drawing random structures on the screen. He spends the rest of the night staring. Working with Processing since 2004, creative coding fuels his curiosity in physical, biological, geometric and computational systems. He'll be talking about creative and generative coding on «Bosphorus» by Refik Anadol during ]unframed[ Close up."
