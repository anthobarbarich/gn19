description = "A unique experience of virtual reality sound. Based on a prototype developed for the experiment by the studio Demute in Brussels, this technology called «Room Scale Augmented Audio» allows, with a simple headphone on the ears, to immerse itself in a sound universe in 3 dimensions and interact with him. It will therefore be proposed to visitors to enter a classroom that will virtually come alive through the headset, and to interact physically with the sound elements that will be offered to them. Speakers : Wouter Gordts (Demute), Patrick Séverin (HorsZone)."
