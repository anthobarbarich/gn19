description = "Collectives Demute and Hors Zone will be presenting their peculiar work, a unique experience of virtual reality sound. Based on a prototype developed for the experiment by the studio Demute in Brussels, this technology called «Room Scale Augmented Audio» allows, with a simple headphone on the ears, to immerse itself in a sound universe in 3 dimensions and interact with it. It will therefore be offered to visitors to enter a classroom that will virtually come alive through the headset, and to interact physically with the sound elements that will be offered to them."
