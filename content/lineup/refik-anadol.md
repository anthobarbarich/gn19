description = "«Bosphorus» is a data sculpture which finds its inspiration from a data collection coming from high frequency radars located near the Marmara Sea. The data is provided by the Turkish meteorological service every 30 minutes. The data collection is done over 30 days, detailing sea-surface activity, which is then artistically translated on a monumental LED screen and into a poetic experience."
