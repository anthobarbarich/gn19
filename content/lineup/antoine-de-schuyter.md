description = "«Still Life N°1» mixes sculpture, projection and sound creation. The installation is reactive to external stimuli, and is constantly evolving and changing, which offer ever changing visual and sonorous textures. The overlays of projected matter, textiles and changing points of view the spectator will be subjected to will blur sensations and give the impression of looking at a living landscape in permanent evolution."
