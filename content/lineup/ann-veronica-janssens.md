description = "Ann Veronica Janssens artistry could be defined as a research based on sensory experience. Through various devices, Ann Veronica Janssens invites onlookers to cross a new sensitive threshold, at the limits of vertigo and glare. Hot Pink is composed of a projector equipped with a halogen bulb and a dichroic filter. The filter only lets through certain light wavs and reflects the spectrum instead of absorbing it. According to the angle it is positioned in, the filter will let through a large spectrum of saturated colours which when modified will provoke a significative change of the peripheral colour.  The light projection disperses itself along the walls and the ceiling of the room in a dazzling combination of halos of different colours."
