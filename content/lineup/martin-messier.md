description = "With Bo√Æte Noire, Martin Messier focuses on putting into motion and sound a light beam projected onto a large prism with translucid walls. Trying to define the shape of this elusive matter, he materializes its amplitudes and decomposes its frequencies. In a dark room, the spectator will see and hear the evolution of this white spectrum: its contractions and dilations, curves and traces, appearances and disappearances. As if this black box emitted ghostly signals coming from past events, Messier will invite onlookers to reconstruct the story behind it."
