description = "Two storied musicians and collaborators from disparate disciplines come together to create a\nnew, fluid musical vernacular. Shackleton’s work over the course of his deep catalogue has come to transcend its roots in electronic bass culture; fusing minimalism with esoteric production, shades of light and dark and a desire to keep moving ever forward, his is music that creates vivid imagery for the mind’s eye. Similarly, with his nods to minimalism, jazz, electronic and global influences, Wacław Zimpel\nis recognised as one of the most original and unique talents to have emerged not just from his native Poland, but also Europe, since the turn of the century."
