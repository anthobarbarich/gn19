description = "Mathieu Zurstrassen's «KEOEEIT» is a connected device which allows to simulate light phenomena characterized by colorized veils which can be seen in the night sky around the poles when there is strong geomagnetic activity. This installation is fuelled by data dating from 1932 to today, coming from 13 observatories scattered around the globe, at a one day per second rhythm. The device will be connected to 8 robotic arms which will oscillate in function on the values which are fed to «KEOEEIT».\n*Scintillating aurora before dawn in Eskimo language\nProgrammation : Martin Pirson"
