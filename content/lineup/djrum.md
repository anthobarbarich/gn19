description = "Djrum is a perennially acclaimed underground artist since his first release in 2010, who’s quietly built a list of fans that reads like a who’s who of contemporary dance music for his ability to deftly fuse a range of genres from jazz, hip hop and dubstep to ambient and techno. A keen listener of all things new and old, his talent is in effortlessly combining his influences into a completely personal and bewitching aesthetic all of his own."
