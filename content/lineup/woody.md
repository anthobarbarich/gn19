description = "Hailing from Delft, Woody'92 has honed his skills as a DJ over many years, and plots a meditative course from pensive ambient and mind-bending electronics, through psychoactive ritual and subdued goa, and into vital rhythm edged with unfurling, lysergic fractals. Heâ€™s become a staple at Dekmantel, Garage Noord, De School, and BAR - where he runs The DOJO with partner in crime Spekki Webu."
