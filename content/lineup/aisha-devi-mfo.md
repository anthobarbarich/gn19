description = "No one on this planet sounds like Aïsha Devi. Her voice is her most powerful tool in a repertoire that includes thumping beats and rave stabs, seraphic and guttural throat singing, mystical linguistics and corporeal sonics. Her music is spiritual and her live shows are transcendent experiences. Visual artist Marcel Weber, aka MFO, works with memory and perception, identity formation and dissolution. For ∞E=TRv, he will work with these lights to create an immersive, otherworldly atmosphere."
