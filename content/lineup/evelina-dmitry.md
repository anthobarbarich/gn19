description = "Dmitry Gelfand and Evelina Domnitch create artworks that merge physics, chemistry and computer science with uncanny philosophical practices. They'll be talking at the ]unframed[ talks and later that evening will be presenting their performance «Force Field». In «Force Field», acoustically levitated water droplets resonate, vaporise and reassemble into spheroids,\ntoroids and oscillating polygons while spinning nearly devoid of shear. The performance simultaneously\ntaps into the 3-dimensionality of sound, the elusive physicality of water, as well as the rotational dynamics\nof celestial and subatomic bodies."
