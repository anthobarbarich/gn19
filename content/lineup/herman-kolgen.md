description = "An acclaimed multidisciplinary artist with more than three decades of experience in media arts, Herman Kolgen, self-defined as an audiocinetic sculptor, draws his raw material from the intimate relationship between sound and image. The impact of territories on human life lies at the heart of his conceptual pursuits. The resulting brutal tensions as well as the interplay between various elements constitute the epicentre of his practice. He works in a constant cycle of exploration, at the crossroads of different media, to conjure up a new technical language and a singular aesthetic."
