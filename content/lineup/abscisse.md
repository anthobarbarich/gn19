description = "«Abscisse» is an installation from Bots conspiracy, which presents a holographic exploration of the boundaries between visible and invisible, translating the evolution of the brainwaves of a member of the public, captured in real time by an electroencephalogram. This installation is a co-production of Ohme and les Garages Numériques and gives an artistic representation of how our different brain regions could work synchronicity. The installation has been developed thanks to the scientific advice of Charline Urbain and Anna Pfeifer from the Center for Research in Cognition & Neurosciences (ULB). Bots conspiracy is a Brussels-based artist collective composed of Manu & Laurent Talbot, two experimenting brothers. The complementarity of the duo has allowed them to deliver a wide variety of works such as short movies, scenic design for theater and cinema, music videos, post-production, 3D and special effects. Their curiosity also led them to robotics, producing questioning installations set in their world influenced by music, contemporary art, mass media, technology and sciences."
