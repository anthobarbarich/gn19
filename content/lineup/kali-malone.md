description = "Headquartered in Stockholm, Kali Malone is an American composer and musician who creates sonic monoliths that tug at the very material of listening. Via analog and digital synthesis – and within compositional frameworks that utilize unique tunings and psycho-acoustic phenomena – Malone’s dark minimalism maintains a certain gravity, even as the ground shifts. In addition to her music practice, Malone co-operates the record label and concert series XKatedral."
