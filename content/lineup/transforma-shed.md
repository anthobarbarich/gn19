description = "Transforma was formed in 2001 in Berlin by Luke Bennett, Baris Hasselbach and Simon Krahl. They produce audiovisual performances, installations, projections for music, video clips, and have worked extensively with theatre and dance. Creating images and atmospheres which establish a connection between the material properties of their subject, abstract storytelling and a hands-on approach to production, they have developed their own language within the live visual experience. «Pokale» is their brand new performance, with a soundtrack by musician Shed."
